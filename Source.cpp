//first test with github repository, from memory from a few days ago. let's figure this out. 

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
	std::cout << "GitHub achievement: u n l o c k e d" << std::endl;
	return 0;
}

//okay, pretty sure the first one went smoothly. pushed to github, ready to modify, and push again and 
//see that we now have two versions? save points?
